# 👋🏼 Nice to meet you!

I'm André Alves, passionate about building mobile apps that make a difference. As a Senior Consultant iOS at Thoughtworks.
9 years of experience in the trenches mean I've tackled it all: high-profile companies, super apps, modular apps, and differents kinds of projects. 


# 📝 Summarizing me

I've already worked with different programming tech stacks, like scripting (C++, Python, and Javascript), but my passion is mobile development (specially iOS-native, using Swift and/or Objective-C).

But wait, there's more! I'm currently pursuing a Master's in AI, diving into machine learning, deep learning, and more.  I believe in collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, striving to be the ultimate mobile dev.

Wanna join the adventure? Explore my projects, contributions, and thoughts on the tech world.  Let's connect!
